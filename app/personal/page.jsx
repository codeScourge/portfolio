            <h2>Backstory</h2>
            <p>
              I was born in Russia and moved to Germany at 6 years old. At 14 I started to get into (very basic) ML and programming in general. 
              One year later I used that knowledge and interest to cofound an <a href="https://neural-reality.de/">AI agency</a>. During that time I taught myself Web Development
              and the Infrastructue behind it on the Cloud. Recently moved to Berlin to study at <a href="https://code.berlin/en/">CODE </a>
